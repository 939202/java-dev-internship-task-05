# Java Developer Internship – Task 5

## 📌 Task Title
Arrays & Basic Data Analysis Program

---

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this task is to understand and implement Java array concepts by performing basic data analysis operations such as sum, average, maximum, minimum, sorting, and exception handling.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Java
- IntelliJ IDEA (Primary)
- Eclipse (Alternative)

---

## 📂 Program Features
- Uses **single-dimensional arrays** to store numerical data
- Calculates:
  - Sum
  - Average
  - Maximum value
  - Minimum value
- Implements **manual sorting (Bubble Sort)** without built-in methods
- Demonstrates **multi-dimensional arrays**
- Handles **ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException**
- Displays results in a clear and formatted manner
- Well-commented code for easy understanding

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Program
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
3. Compile and run `ArrayDataAnalysis.java`
4. View the output in the console

## 📊 Sample Output
===== Array Data Analysis =====
Sorted Array: 12 23 34 45 78 89
Sum: 281
Average: 46.83
Maximum: 89
Minimum: 12

===== Multi-Dimensional Array =====
85 90 78
88 76 92

Accessing invalid index:
Error: Array index is out of bounds!
